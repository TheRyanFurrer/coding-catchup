Coding Catchup is my personal tech blog where I write both technical posts as well as more "devjournal" posts. This is my place to keep myself accountable and give back to the tech community.

I built this using a [Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/thomaswang/gatsby-personal-starter-blog) for ease of getting it up and running but also getting my hands dirty with Gatsby and React.
