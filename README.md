## Coding Catchup v2

This is a refresh of Coding Catchup v1 that was built using a [Gatsby Starter](https://github.com/thomaswang/gatsby-personal-starter-blog) for ease of getting it up and running but also getting my hands dirty with Gatsby and React.

This blog has since been rebranded and moved to [The Ryan Furrer Blog](https://www.theryanfurrer.blog/).
